# SymphoniaSaveEdit
A save viewer and editor for Tales of Symphonia for PC, GC, or PS3.

This is a very old project that I built for myself. Enough people were asking about it though so I was semi-supporting it. I could not keep up with the myriad of requests such as "Make Yuan a playable character" so I lost interest. However, it should support most things you would need to do to your save file.

## History
9/24/2019
* Added support for unencrypted PS3 files since some emulators do not follow the PS3's file format correctly.
  
6/20/2018
* Fixed the offset for PC saves and Affection

* Still haven't tested this at all for PS3 or PC saves (Backup your saves). Please report any issues.

## Using Manual Edit
Any number you see preceeded by "0x" is a hex number. Be sure to leave the "0x" when editing, and 
remember to convert your number to hex.
